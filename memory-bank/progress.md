# Progress: Rate Key

**Current Status:** Initial setup phase. A basic form component exists but requires further development.

**What Works:**

- The application structure is set up (Tauri + React + Vite).
- The `AddKeyForm` component renders without the initial `ReferenceError`.
- Basic form state management is initialized using `react-hook-form`.
- Memory Bank core files created.

**What's Left to Build:**

- Define the actual data structure/schema for a "key".
- Update the `AddKeyForm` Zod schema and form fields accordingly.
- Implement the logic to submit the form data (likely to the Tauri backend).
- Create Tauri backend functions (Rust) to handle key storage/management.
- Integrate the `AddKeyForm` into the main application UI (`App.tsx`).
- Build UI for displaying/managing existing keys.
- Implement any "rate" related functionality if implied by the name.
- Testing.
- Create `.clinerules` file.

**Known Issues:**

- `AddKeyForm` currently uses a placeholder schema (`username`) and `onSubmit` handler (`console.log`).
- No actual key management functionality exists yet.
- The form is not yet integrated into the main application view.
